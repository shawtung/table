# This is a pre-task

Design and implement a table component using React + TypeScript to meet the following requirements.

1. Fixed the table header and can specify to sort by the value of a column in positive or reverse order (front-end sorting is enough).
2. Support specifying left n columns or right n columns to be fixed when scrolling horizontally.
3. Support pagination and specify the page size.
4. Add git pre-commit hook to make sure code format & lint passed before committing to code repo.
5. Build a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to deploy the page as GH Pages.
